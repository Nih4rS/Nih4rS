# 🔥 Hey there, I'm Nihar Shiva Kumar! 👋

🚀 Machine Learning Engineer | Data Scientist | LLM & Generative AI Enthusiast  
I’m passionate about building ML, NLP, and GenAI systems that solve real-world challenges and unlock new possibilities. Most days you’ll find me iterating on LLM fine-tuning workflows, shipping data products, or exploring how AI can advance sustainability. Outside of work: chess, piano, and long hikes.
